# web-virtual-try-on
This web app lets users see how clothes would look on them without having to try them on physically. The app uses a state-of-the-art generative model to create a static image of the user wearing the clothing item. The generative model is trained on a large dataset of clothing and human images to create the most realistic try-ons possible.
